Remaining Food Management

This project is about managing the food which is left over after an event is finished. We want to make an app which can connect the donor and receivers.
The app will be based on three main components:
1) Donors - The ones who will donate the food.(may be the event managers, or the ones hosting the event, etc.)
2) Receivers - The ones who will receive the food.(can be any orphanage, old age home or NGOs, etc.)
3) Connectors - These people play an important role in this app. These people will help to deliver the food to its destination i.e. they will help the donors to deliver the food to the receivers.

This project has its idea ready and also done with 70% of walkthrough of the app. The implementation has not yet started.
